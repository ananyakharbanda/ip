# Project context

This repository is a starter template for a greenfield Java project used in an introductory software engineering course in an undergraduate computer science program. Students use it as the starting point for their own projects.

# Default user context

Unless the user says otherwise, assume that you are assisting a student working on a project in this repository. If the user identifies themselves as an instructor or another project stakeholder, adapt your response to that role.

# Student profile

* Prior knowledge: Basic Java and OOP concepts.
* Level of programming experience: Intermediate
* IDE and level of expertise: Intellij

# Guidance for interacting with users

* Explain the rationale for significant actions: what you did and why.
* Keep explanations brief but instructive, supporting learning through responsible use of AI. For example:

  * When suggesting a Git command, briefly explain what it does.
  * Add explanatory Javadoc comments to all classes and to nontrivial methods and fields when their purpose or behavior is not obvious.
  * Make generated code as self-explanatory as possible, and include explanatory comments where they improve understanding.
  * When faced with a design choice, choose the simplest option that is sufficient for the requirements, while briefly explaining relevant more advanced alternatives.

## Java coding standard

All Java code in this project must follow the SE-EDU basic and intermediate
Java coding standard. Use the reusable project skill at
`.codex/skills/seedu-java-coding-standard/SKILL.md` for every Java change; it
is based on the authoritative
[SE-EDU Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html).

In particular, keep classes in lower-case packages, use the prescribed naming
and visibility conventions, use four-space indentation and K&R braces, keep
lines within 120 characters, use explicit imports, and provide descriptive
Javadoc for public classes and methods. Preserve the existing `duchess` package
structure when adding Java files.

# Project-specific requirements

## Java version:

Ensure that Java 25 is used when running the application or build tasks. On macOS, use `sdk use java 25.0.3.fx-zulu` to switch to Java 25 if needed.

## Git

Use lightweight tags unless the user requests an annotated tag.
When proposing or creating a commit message, include enough detail to explain the rationale for the change.
For every task that changes files, provide a suggested commit message for the user
to apply. Leave changes uncommitted by default; only commit when the user
explicitly asks for that task, and never push changes.

## Git coding standard

All future commits and branches in this project must follow the SE-EDU Git
conventions. Use the reusable project skill at
`.codex/skills/seedu-git-standard/SKILL.md` before preparing a commit or branch.

Commit subjects must be imperative, start with a capital letter, omit a final
period, and stay within the 72-character hard limit. Add a separated, 72-column
wrapped body for non-trivial commits explaining what changed and why. Use
meaningful kebab-case branch names, or the issue-number format when applicable.

## After code updates

After every update to application code:

1. Review `test/ui-test-plan.md` and add or update test cases when the code
   changes user-visible behavior or introduces a relevant scenario. If the
   existing cases still cover the behavior, leave the plan unchanged.
2. Invoke the project-specific `$test-ui` skill from the repository root:
   `python3 .codex/skills/test-ui/scripts/run_ui_tests.py`.
3. Treat a failed UI test as a failed change. Stop, report the actual and
   expected output, and do not present the code update as verified until the
   failure is resolved.
